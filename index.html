                    <p class="text-left">It all started May 2013, the Xbox One had just been announced by Microsoft with a $500 price tag - I believed it was too much. My family had just purchased a relatively decent computer the year before - with an i5, 8GB of RAM, and
                        1TB hard drive - and I believed that I could easily have a decent gaming computer with a bought a $200 graphics card. I spent months doing research, I would watch YouTube videos after school, I began with videos card, then processor
                        and then I moved all the way to custom water cooling systems. I waited for Black Friday to buy my graphics card and power supply unit to go along with it - I bought an AMD Radeon R9 270X. Little did I know this was the beginning
                        of something bigger for me.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">Even after I had bought my graphics card, I was still spending hours and days looking up videos and articles on computer hardware. On May 2014, I had decided to build my own computer, I was determined not to skimp on any components,
                        I wanted to go balls to the wall - I knew it wasn't going to be cheap. I got a job over the summer and began to save money and began to buy the parts, one by one.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">Building my own computer was not enought. I had to take the next step - custom water cooling. Even after that I was not done, I moved into SLI systems. Computer hardware was one of the few subjects that no one in school taught me about,
                        and everything I had learned at the time was on my own, and I loved it.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">I started college as a Computer Engineering major because of my love for computer hardware. My first two classes as a Computer Engineering major were Programming Fundamentals I and II. During my time in these classes, I realized how
                        much I enjoyed Computer Science over Computer Engineering; and switched. Throughout my semesters at University of Florida, I have fallen in love with Computer Science, software development, and web development, more and more every
                        day.
