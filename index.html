            It all started May 2013, the Xbox One had just been announced by Microsoft with a $500 price tag - I believed it was too much. My family had just purchased a relatively decent computer the year before - with an i5, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB hard drive - and
            I believed that I could easily have a decent gaming computer with a $200 graphics card. I spent months doing research, reading news, watching YouTube videos. On Black Friday 2013, I bought a Sapphire Radeon R9 270X. Even after I had bought
            my graphics card, I was still spending hours and days looking up videos and articles on computer hardware. On May 2014, I had decided to build my own computer, I was determined not to skimp on any components, I wanted to go all out - I knew
            it wasn't going to be cheap. I got a job over the summer and began to save money and began to buy the parts, one by one. Building my own computer was not enough. I had to take the next step - custom water cooling. Even after that I was not
            done, I moved into SLI systems. Computer hardware was one of the few subjects that no one in school taught me about, and everything I had learned at the time was on my own, and I loved it. I started college as a Computer Engineering major
            because of my love for computer hardware. My first two classes as a Computer Engineering major were Programming Fundamentals I and II. During my time in these classes, I realized how much I enjoyed Computer Science over Computer Engineering;
            and switched. Throughout my semesters at University of Florida, I have fallen in love with Computer Science, software development, and web development, more and more every day.
